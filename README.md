_Reporter_ is a Clojure wrapper around the Jasper Reports library,
responsible for the production of complex reports, best generated by
Jasper.

The primary desired format is well-typeset PDF, with Microsoft Word `.docx`,
PowerPoint `.pptx`, LibreOffice Writer `.odt`, Calc spreadsheet compatible
`.ods` outputs, as well as the rich-text file format `.rtf`. CSV, HTML and
Microsoft Excel `.xls` and `.xlsx` outputs are also available, but these can
often be produced more easily by Language-native libraries.

Reporter's job is to take away the pain of Java programming, offering the raw
power and rich ecosystem of the Java virtual machine by way of a Lisp language.
